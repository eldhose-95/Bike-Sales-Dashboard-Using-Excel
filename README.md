 valuable insights such as:

- The sales figures based on the average income of customers in a particular region and occupation
- The overall sales of bikes in Europe, North America, and the Pacific
- The target customers based on their age bracket
- And the sales based on the customer's commute distance.

This information can help a company determine their target customers based on various factors such as region, age, average income, marital status, and occupation. Additionally, it can provide a basis for developing new strategies to improve the marketing and overall sales of bikes.

During the process of building this dashboard, I learned various techniques such as:
- Data analysis and cleaning
- Using Excel formulas and functions
- Creating pivot tables
- Designing the dashboard
- Slicer formatting
